			  <p>Unity Center was organized in 1998 as an outreach ministry of Broad Street United Methodist Church. In 1999, the ministry organized to begin offering summer day camps and a 2-day
				   per week after school program (FUTURE - Fun at Unity Totally United Reaching for Excellence) with an average attendance of 15.</p>
			  <p>In addition to the FUTURE After School Program, the Unity Center ministry hosted family activities centered around holidays and in 2000 began the first Unity Community Choir.</p>			
			  <p>During the period of 2001 to 2011 there were several highlights: the 1st Teacher Tea, adding 2 additional days to the FUTURE After School Program, the organization of a 
				  Youth Leader Program and the DAWN (Disciples Acting With Nobility)Youth Program, partnerships with Lee University for tutors and interns, Dressed for Success program began, Youth Leader trip to Washington 
				  DC for citizenship seminars, and a Piano Lab was added. Average attendance had grown to 62.</p>
				<p>Several building renovations and additions have taken place as well: in 2001 the previous sanctuary was converted and renovated to become the Community Building. In 2008 we 
					completed a complete renovation of the basement and upstairs entrance of the Community Building. In 2010 we acquired adjoining property on the North East side of the Community Building. 
					This area has become a playfield and is also used for extra parking in large events. In 2013, the building located at 1030 6th Street was renovated and opened as the Unity Center Melting Pot. 
					It houses offices and meeting space for the youth group and adult classes. In 2014, an addition to the Home Place was completed, this included a new kitchen, new bathrooms, and storage space. 
					With this final addition, capacity availability was increased for the FUTURE After School program.</p>			
				<p>In the period of 2012-the present there are additional highlights: an additional trip to Washington DC for selected youth leaders, a snack preparation team was added, a program for immigration 
					advocacy and support was added. Average attendance in the after-school program has grown to over 90.</p>		
				<p>There are many goals, plans and dreams for the future of the Unity Center ministry. We are thankful to the countless individuals and groups who have believed and believe in this ministry. 
					Above all we are thankful to God for everything!!</p>

					<h4>Unity Center seeks to build hope and opportunity by promoting educational, social and spiritual growth for all.</h4>
					<p>Unity Center was established in June of 1998 as an outreach ministry of Broad Street United Methodist Church, to build community 
						in East Cleveland. Unity Center firmly believes in equality and therefore welcomes students of various races, ethnicities, and 
						religious and non-religious affiliations. The FUTURE After School Program is a primary program of Unity Center.  Family events 
						throughout the year help develop and nurture the Unity Community. </p>

					<h2 class="display-4">PROGRAM GROWTH</h2>
					<p>In 1999, Unity Center began to offer summer day camps and the FUTURE 2-day per week after school program with an average of 15 students.  Through the past 20 
						plus years the afterschool program has grown to 4 days per week with an enrollment of 135 students.</p>	
						<p>Along with building renovations and additions, numerous enrichment and life skill programs now enhance and supplement 
							the studentsâ€™ daily experience.  It does take an ever- expanding community of volunteers to keep this ministry
							 thriving.  Partnerships with Lee University, Cleveland State, Broad Street UMC, other community members provide 
							 valuable volunteer leadership.</p>

					<p>As the Unity Center Community has developed and students graduate, have their own families and return, the challenge of meeting the needs of the future lies before us.  Goals of improving our facilities to make them more safe and secure; adding a fifth day to the after school program and even launching 
						satellite centers in the greater Cleveland community will enable this outreach ministry to continue its impact.</p>

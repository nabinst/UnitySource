					<h4>Unity Center seeks to build hope and opportunity by promoting educational, social and spiritual growth for all.</h4>
					<p>Unity Center was established in June of 1998 as an outreach ministry of Broad Street United Methodist Church, to build community 
						in East Cleveland. Unity Center firmly believes in equality and therefore welcomes students of various races, ethnicities, and 
						religious and non-religious affiliations. The FUTURE After School Program is a primary program of Unity Center.  Family events 
						throughout the year help develop and nurture the Unity Community. </p>

					<h2 class="display-4">PROGRAM GROWTH</h2>
					<p>In 1999, Unity Center began to offer summer day camps and the FUTURE 2-day per week after school program with an average of 15 students.  Through the past 20 
						plus years the afterschool program has grown to 4 days per week with an enrollment of 135 students.</p>	
						<p>Along with building renovations and additions, numerous enrichment and life skill programs now enhance and supplement 
							the studentsâ€™ daily experience.  It does take an ever- expanding community of volunteers to keep this ministry
							 thriving.  Partnerships with Lee University, Cleveland State, Broad Street UMC, other community members provide 
							 valuable volunteer leadership.</p>

					<h2 class="display-4">DREAMS for TOMORROW</h2>
					<p>As the Unity Center Community has developed and students graduate, have their own families and return, the challenge of meeting the needs of the future lies before us.  Goals of improving our facilities to make them more safe and secure; adding a fifth day to the after school program and even launching 
						satellite centers in the greater Cleveland community will enable this outreach ministry to continue its impact.</p>
